# Code8 or 8 – A Lightweight Multi-language Code Editor

# Code8  or 8 is a minimalist, multi-language code editor built with Python and PyQt5, designed to provide a hands-on app development experience. It’s simple, extendable, and a perfect playground for learning programming and creating small projects.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is not just about making a text editor — it's about:
- Learning **GUI development with PyQt**
- Gaining full-stack **desktop app dev experience**
- Handling files, executing code, and managing output
- Building a real tool you can use and extend
- Prepping for bigger projects (like your planner app!)
